C This is the control file for the GEANT simulation
C Parameters defined in this file control the kind
C and extent of simulation that is performed.  The
C full list of options is given in section base-40
C of the GEANT manual

c The following two lines generate single-track events provided that
c events.in does not contain an input file name starting in column 1.
c The meaning of the arguments is as follows.
c KINE ipart momentum theta phi delta_momentum delta_theta delta_phi
c  - ipart = GEANT particle type of primary track + 100
c  - momentum = initial track momentum, central value (GeV/c)
c  - theta = initial track polar angle, central value (degrees)
c  - phi = initial track azimuthal angle, central value (degrees)
c  - delta_momentum = spread in initial track momentum, full width (GeV/c)
c  - delta_theta = spread in initial track polar angle, full width (degrees)
c  - delta_phi = spread in initial track azimuthal angle, full width (degrees)
c SCAP vertex_x vertex_y vertex_z
c  - vertex_[x,y,z] = coordinates of primary vertex in MRS (cm)

c The following two lines generate electrons inside the bremsstrahlung
c radiator.  In conjunction with DIAGNOSE_BREMSSTRAHLUNG in gustep.F
c this was used to simulate a full bremsstrahlung beam, resulting in
c the following normalization for a tagged beam of 50M tags/s in the
c tagging window from 4.37 to 5.36 GeV.
c       tagged rate on target: 		44.7e6
c	generated events per beam s:	3.92e9
c	beam time per generated event:	0.255 ns
c	generated events per lgd gate:	494
c These average rates can be used to estimate how much background must
c be added to the signal to obtain an accurate bg noise estimate in MC.

c The following line controls the rate of background bremsstrahlung photons
c that are overlayed on each event in the simulation, in addition to the
c particles produced by the standard generation mechanism.  This rate of
c background production is applied for the duration of the ADC gate.  A
c value of 3.92 corresponds to nominal Radphi running conditions at a
c tagged photon rate of 50MHz.  To disable the generation of random
c background, comment this line out or set the value to zero.  Background
c is not generated for one-track simulations that are produced using the
c KINE c directive (see above).
